## About Oasis Infobyte

he Data Science internship organized by OASIS INFOBYTE and supported by AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education) is designed to provide students and early-career professionals with practical experience in data science.. Our mission is to empower organizations by transforming data into actionable insights.

## Internship Overview

As a data science intern at Oasis Infobyte, you'll gain hands-on experience in data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. You'll work on real-world projects that will help you develop skills in statistical analysis, machine learning, and data storytelling.

## Objectives

Learn and apply data analysis techniques using Python, R, and other tools.
Work with large datasets to extract meaningful insights.
Collaborate with a team of data scientists and analysts.
Present findings through reports and visualizations.

## Key Projects

Task 1 : Iris Flower Prediction - ris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

Task 2 : UnEmployement Data Analysis - Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.

Task 3 : Car Price Prediction - he price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.

Task 4 : Email Spam Detection - We've all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content. In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let's get started!

Task 5 : Sales Prediction Analysis - Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
